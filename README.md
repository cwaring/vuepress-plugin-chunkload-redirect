# vuepress-plugin-chunkload-redirect

üê∂ Catch chunkload errors from a stale deploy and route to destination.

Clientside apps remain in the browser memory and if a new build is deployed sometimes the JS chunks could change resulting in errors routing to a destination that is not preloaded. This plugin will detect when a page chunk is no longer avaliable by catching the error and redirecting the user to the latest version of the application with a full reload.

Compatible with Vuepress 1.x

## Usage

npm i -D vuepress-plugin-chunkload-redirect
